# Active Context

## Current Focus
**Initialization of the Memory Bank and Agent Rules.**
We are establishing the "Brain" of the project to ensure all future agent interactions are context-aware and consistent.

## Active Tasks
- [x] Analyze Repository & Existing Documentation
- [x] Create Memory Bank Structure
- [x] Create Agent Rules (`.agent/rules/00-memory-bank.md`)
- [x] Verification of "Project Brain" activation.
- [x] Log Prompts (Correction)

## Recent Changes
- Created `/memory-bank/` directory.
- Populated `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`.

## Next Steps
1. Create strict agent rule file.
2. Confirm setup with user.
