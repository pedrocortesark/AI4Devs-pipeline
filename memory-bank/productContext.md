# Product Context

## Problem Statement
Recruitment processes often involve managing large volumes of candidate data scattered across emails, spreadsheets, and file folders. This leads to inefficiency, lost data, and a poor experience for both recruiters and candidates. LTI aims to centralize this process into a single, intuitive platform.

## User Personas
1. **Recruiter / HR Manager**
   - **Goal:** Efficiently manage the hiring pipeline.
   - **Needs:** Quick access to candidate details, clear visibility of candidate status, easy mechanisms to update information and move candidates between stages.
   - **Pain Points:** Disorganized data, manual tracking errors, difficulty in finding resumes.

2. **Candidate (Indirect User)**
   - **Goal:** Get hired.
   - **Needs:** Their data to be accurately represented and processed fairly and timely.
   - **Pain Points:** Application falling through cracks due to system inefficiency.

## User Workflow
1. **Entry:** Candidate data is entered into the system (via manual entry or potential future integrations).
2. **Review:** Recruiters review candidate profiles, CVs, and experience.
3. **Tracking:** Candidates are moved through customizable stages (e.g., Inbox -> Screen -> Interview -> Offer).
4. **Decision:** Candidate is either Hired or Rejected, and the system records the outcome.
